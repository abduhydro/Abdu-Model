This reclassification ensures the data is in a format suitable for the PRMS and MODFLOW components.\n",

        "    Yes, the land use and soil data have been successfully loaded, their dimensions and georeferencing transforms verified, and then reclassified into processed arrays (`processed_land_use_data` and `processed_soil_data`). This reclassification step prepares them for direct use in the PRMS and MODFLOW components of the GSFLOW model, confirming their readiness.\n",

        "*   The `Upper_Gibe_Soil.tif` file was successfully loaded, yielding a soil data array with a shape of `(100, 100)`. Its georeferencing transform was also extracted, indicating a resolution of 100 units per pixel.\n",
        "*   The raw `land_use_data` was reclassified into `processed_land_use_data` based on a predefined mapping. The unique values in the processed data are `[-999, 1, 2, 3]`, where `-999` represents unmapped or NoData values.\n",

        "*   **How was the MODFLOW 6 model structure built?**\n",
        "    The MODFLOW 6 model structure was built using the `flopy` library within Python. The process involved defining the MODFLOW 6 executable path (`MF6_EXE`), setting up a dedicated workspace (`WORK_WS`), and then utilizing a custom `build_modflow6_model` function. This function initialized the `MFSimulation` (simulation) and `MFModel` (groundwater flow, GWF) objects, configured the discretization (DIS), initial conditions (IC), hydraulic properties (NPF), and output control (OC) packages, based on the calculated grid dimensions (`nrow`, `ncol`, `cell_size`).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Is the MODFLOW 6 model structure ready for further configuration?**\n",
        "    Yes, the basic MODFLOW 6 model structure, including the `sim` and `gwf` objects, has been successfully created. The necessary spatial parameters (`nrow`, `ncol`, `cell_size`), executable path, and workspace have all been correctly defined and initialized. The model is now ready for the addition of boundary conditions, stress packages, and other detailed configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `flopy` and `numpy` dependencies were successfully resolved, ensuring compatibility for MODFLOW 6 model construction.\n",
        "*   The `WORKDIR` and `MF6_EXE` paths were accurately set to `/content/gsflow_v2_work` and `/content/bin/mf6`, respectively.\n",
        "*   The `settlements` and `wells` data were loaded, and their geographical coordinates were successfully transformed from WGS84 (EPSG:4326) to UTM zone 37N (EPSG:32637), handling potential non-numeric or NaN values.\n",
        "*   The model grid dimensions were dynamically calculated based on the spatial extent of the loaded data, resulting in `nrow=177` and `ncol=177` with a `cell_size=1000.0` meters.\n",
        "*   The MODFLOW 6 simulation (`sim`) and groundwater flow (`gwf`) objects were instantiated, creating the foundational structure for the hydrological model within the specified workspace (`/content/gsflow_v2_work/mf6_base`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The successful creation of the MODFLOW 6 model structure marks a critical milestone in the hydrological modeling process.\n",
        "*   The next steps should involve integrating specific geological layers, defining boundary conditions (e.g., rivers, general head boundaries, wells, recharge), and setting up appropriate stress periods for transient simulations. This will allow for a more detailed and accurate representation of the Upper Gibe Basin's hydrological system."

I will update the `mf6_zip_url` to point to the direct `mf6` binary, adjust the download command, and remove the unzipping logic, setting `MF6_EXE` directly to the downloaded file.

        "The previous code failed to download the `mf6` executable due to a `404 Not Found` error from the specified URL, preventing the simulation from running and generating output files. To fix this, I will update the `prepare_mf6_binary` function to use a reliable direct download link for the MODFLOW 6 executable (version 6.5.0, Linux) from the official `MODFLOW-ORG` GitHub releases. This will involve using `curl -L` for better redirect handling and ensuring the downloaded file is indeed the executable and not an error page. After successfully downloading and setting execute permissions, the `sim` object's `exe_name` will be updated, the simulation files written, and the model run. Finally, the head data from `ghb_gwf.hds` will be read and displayed as requested by the task.\n",

This script will install `flopy` and its dependencies, ensure necessary files are located and copied, prepare the MODFLOW 6 executable, build and run the model, and then read the `ghb_gwf.cbb` file to generate and display the budget summary as requested by the subtask.
